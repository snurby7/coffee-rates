# Coffee Rates

This project is just going to be a collection of coffees and where they're from so it can be rated and all that fun.
Similar to untappd, but for coffee since that's something useful to me and I'm sure other coffee fans!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Package Manager

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

## Unit Testing

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)<br>
[react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library)

## Backend/API

[OvernightJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overnightjs/core)<br>

## Database/Storage

Mongo DB Atlas

## Set up

```
  // create the following file in src/controllers/key/   connection-string.ts
  export const enum ConnectionData {
    UserString = '<CONNECTION STRING>',
    // String format example   'mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@bruns-projects-5dltw.mongodb.net/coffee-rates',
  }
```

## Start untappd

- To start up the project you may need to do the following
- `yarn install` from the root directory
  - may need to also run `yarn install` from the client folder as well
- You should then see OvernightJs running on port 3001 and the UI on port 3000

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back! Just don't do it!**
